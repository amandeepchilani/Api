	<h3>3.  Don’t take eve teasing lightly</h3>
      Respond with a stern voice
 Threaten to take a picture which might scare them away
       If the eve teasing still persists then immediately raise your voice to gather a crowd</section>

<h3>4.As much as possible avoid late night travel using public transport</h3>
       If avoiding is not possible then be sure to travel only on crowded bus
      Avoid taking road side cabs
  Avoid using a bus which has no passenger or few passenger</section>

       Avoid parking at desolate area
      Look inside the car especially the back seat before unlocking & entering
